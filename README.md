# Password-Manager
This is meant to be a simple password generator/manager. The goal is to make a very lightweight version of something like Bitwarden that will run on a desktop with a gui and everything.

# What I have been learning from this project

This is my first real Java project so everything is pretty new. I have started the project by creating a password generator which required me to learn about HashMaps and how to use the Random module.
